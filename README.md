# **Bootcamp Project Idea** <br>`Wren Hall`

## <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/6.x/svgs/regular/clipboard.svg"  height="24px"> **_Description:_** 

I will be creating a dashboard to help organize and plan a personal Unity project. This will include timelines of what I'm currently working on as well as a small wiki with the details I've already worked out. Additionally, I'll create forms so that I can easily add to the wiki, or update my timeline/gantt chart.

I plan on updating a sample MySQL database with some of this data, using an API though ASP.NET for CRUD functionality and using Angular to navigate a user though this process. I may include some of ASP.NET's user authentication just for extra practice. I also intend to explore more of Angular's built-in unit testing features, once I've learned more about them.

By the time I have completed this project, I will hopefully have learned enough about web dev to be comfortable creating basic projects with Angular and ASP.NET Core. <br><br>

This project should show basic competency with:

- An Angular frontend
- An ASP.NET backend
- EF Core for interfacing with a local MySQL database

In addition, the project will demonstrate a good grasp of

- Unit / integration testing
- ~~Wrangling~~ Adapting VSCode to work with ASP.NET
- Using best practices / architecture with Angular, ASP.NET, and Git
- Working with basic APIs
- Angular routing and routing guards
- Version control

    Notes for Goal:
    - presentation, business, database layers,
    - saving data,
    - SOLID principles of OO,
    - classes focused on one thing,
    - use dependence injection,
    - version control.
    - focus on the process`
